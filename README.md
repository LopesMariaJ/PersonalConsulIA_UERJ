# PersonalConsulIA_UERJ

This project is the final submission for the Deep Learning Course at UERJ, conducted in collaboration with Semcon. The objective is to develop a prototype of a personal AI consultant, named 'Personal Consul IA'. The consultant leverages Ollama, chosen for its enhanced security and reliability when handling sensitive business information, and LangChain to manage document processing and AI interactions. This project aims to provide a trusted and efficient solution for businesses seeking secure, local AI assistance.
