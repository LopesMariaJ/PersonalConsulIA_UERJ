# PersonalConsulIA_UERJ

This project is the final submission for the Deep Learning Course at UERJ, conducted in collaboration with Semcon. The primary objective is to develop a prototype of a personal AI consultant, 'Personal Consul IA,' utilizing LangChain and the RAG methodology. The project focuses on efficiently handling specific documents required to feed the AI, with enhanced security and reliability provided by Ollama for sensitive business information that cannot be made available online. Additionally, Lightning AI is used for development, offering tools and frameworks to support the implementation. This project serves as a practical exercise to apply and enhance knowledge in AI and related technologies.
