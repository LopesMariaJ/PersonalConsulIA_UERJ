# PersonalConsulIA_UERJ

This project is the final submission for the Deep Learning Course at UERJ, conducted in collaboration with Semcon. The primary objective is to develop a prototype of a personal AI consultant, 'Personal Consul IA,' utilizing LangChain and the RAG methodology. This consultant aims to efficiently handle specific documents required to feed the AI, ensuring enhanced security and reliability. The use of Ollama is pivotal for maintaining confidentiality and security when dealing with sensitive business information that cannot be made available online. This project offers a robust solution for secure and efficient local AI assistance.
